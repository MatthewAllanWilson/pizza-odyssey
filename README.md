# pizza-odyssey
Lab Project for Wednesday March 23rd

The goal was to put info from the pizza store we created yesterday into tables, as opposed to the lists we used yesterday.

Instead of starting with my code from yesterday, I decided to start with the example code from the lectures as my template.  I made comments in the code to try and show that I know what each part is doing, as a few parts I did not have to change at all after copying and pasting from the example.

I was able to get everything to appear correctly on the page except for the headers.  I am guessing this is because of something with the html tags, which I will need to explore further.
